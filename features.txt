    *Highlight/Glow an entire set if one of that set's pieces is pinned/equipped?
    *If a piece is pinned/equipped, that piece will show up regardless of filters, but other pieces in the same set will show up as N/A in Set View if filtered out

    *Should pinning/equipping snap a set/piece to the top? Kind of annoying in set-view
